# Tile-Basic v0.1
This is a simple tile editor for pygame game developers. This program allows the user to visually create a tilemap that can then be exported as pygame code. The resulting code will create pygame code that will load the tilemap and draw it to the pygame screen.

### Dependencies
#### Tkinter
Tkinter provides the program with a graphical user interface. To run this script, you will need the Tkinter library installed. 

Windows and MacOS:
  If you are using Windows or MacOS you should already have tkinter built in your python distribution.

Linux:
  If you are using a debian based linux distribution and you do not already have tkinter installed, run the command
  ```
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
  ```
#### Pillow
Pillow provides the program with a quick and easy way to load, draw, and manipulate images. To run this python script, you will need the Pillow imaging library. To install the Pillow, run the following commands:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
```
Once Pillow and Tkinter are installed, you should be ready to run the program.
